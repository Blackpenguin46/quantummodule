      <p>
        As quantum computing advances, it is essential to adopt quantum-safe cryptography (PQC) to protect data. PQC methods are designed to withstand quantum attacks and prevent vulnerabilities in current encryption standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Businesses need to recognize the risks posed by quantum computing and react by adopting PQC standards. These measures will help future-proof systems and ensure continued data security in the face of evolving threats.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key strategies include developing and integrating PQC algorithms and transitioning from traditional encryption methods to quantum-resistant protocols.
