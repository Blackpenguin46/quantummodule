      <p>
        Quantum computing leverages properties of quantum mechanics to solve complex problems that traditional computers cannot. 
        Unlike classical computing, which uses binary bits, quantum computing uses qubits. These qubits can represent multiple states at once due to superposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine quantum computing as a special umbrella that can adapt to cover multiple storms at once, whereas classical computing handles one scenario at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This new paradigm has the potential to disrupt many industries, especially sectors like cybersecurity, by challenging current encryption standards.
